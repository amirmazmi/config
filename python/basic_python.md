## Preamble


## 1. Terminal

Use of terminal is basic for managing python, including creating and managing virtual environments, running jupyter notebooks, even executing python scripts.

In windows, there are 2 terminal available, command prompt and powershell. While powershell is a powerful terminal, using command prompt is (**relatively** safer) and easier.

The easiest way to open command prompt in the folder you would like to operate, is to open the location in file explorer and type `cmd` in the address bar.



### 2. Python scripts
Python scripts are scripts that have been created and can run by itself. These are simply *text files* with a `.py` extension to indicate it is a python file. In some terminals, the file can also have a `.txt` extension or even no extension at all and will still execute/run.


Example:
> hello.py
> ```
> print("Hello world")
> ```

Execute in terminal
`python hello.py`


Basic commands
 - `cd` - change directory
 - `dir` or `ls` - list directory (show contents of current directory)
 - `pwd` - present working directory

The terminal is a powerful tool that can control the entire operating system and is lightweight.

Terminal usually operates on the present working directory, similar to using a file explorer where you are only able to see the contents of the current location. The current location is shown at the prompt `C:/User/user

So attempting to execute hello.py would not work (since the terminal cannot see the file. can check using dir).
